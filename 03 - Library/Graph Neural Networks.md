## Description

Graph neural Networks, or GNNs are neural  networks specially constructed to be applied to graph structures. 

There are some functions and processes specific to GNNs, some of these include:
- aggregation operators
	- how do we propagate knowledge throughout the graph
	- 

## Mathematics


## Applications

There are some arguments to be made about the similarity between transformers and GNNs structure. ([[Transformers are GNNs]])
